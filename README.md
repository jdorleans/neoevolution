Neo Evolution is an Evolutionary Artificial Neural Network framework. It is composed by an EANN algorithm based on [NEAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies). It was created on top of [Spring Boot MVC](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) and [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/).
