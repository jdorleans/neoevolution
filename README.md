NeoEvolution
============

NeoEvolution is an Evolutionary Artificial Neural Network framework based on NEAT.

Autopilot is a modified version of the game: The Plane That Couldn't Fly from BadLogic (https://github.com/badlogic/theplanethatcouldntflygood). It is based on the famous game called Flappy Bird.

The following video shows the best solution found by NeoEvolution algorithm for solving the Autopilot problem. The plane is capable of flying and avoiding the rocks even when the speed of the game increases.
